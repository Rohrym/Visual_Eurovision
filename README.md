# Visual_Eurovision
This is a project where we conducted an exploratory data analysis & visualization on the topic of Eurovision with data extracted from the Spotify API. 
The results of the project have been visualized on our very own [Jupyter Book](juantieme.github.io/project.html) website. 
The graphs on the website are generated using the online visualization tool [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/).

## Repository structure
This repository is build up of four parts. Two data directories and two Juypiter Notebooks. 

- Cooked Data. This directory contains all the data gathered from the Spotify API unaltered.
- Raw Data. This directory contains all the data which has been transformed in various ways to be able to fit the templates from Flourish.
- Code for Conversion. This Juypiter Notebook handles the conversion of the raw data into a form which is useful for our visualizations.
- Code to retrieve data from API. This Jupyter Notebook retrieves the raw data related to Eurovision songs on Spotify between 2010-2021 from the Spotify API.
